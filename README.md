## The problem Clean-Fit solves
Two of the major problems of our Indian society are cleanliness (rather the lack thereof) and the deteriorating health of our citizens. 
It’s time we accept that in the coming time, cleanliness and health are going to be the parameters for measuring the success of a “Smart City”. 
Thus we have developed a way so that the citizens of our country can not only exercise but do it in a fun way, and that too while cleaning up the city. 
The citizens will be provided with a dedicated path for them to cover during their jogging time, and this path will lead through some carefully deliberated parts of the town, 
where they can pick up trash while jogging. The incentive of cleaning their city alongside maintaining their health is complementary to the effort of building a 
strong and clean “Smart City”.In a way, it relieves the burden on the sanitation workers of the city, creates awareness about health, hygiene and cleanliness, and at last, 
helps people contribute to the well being of their city in a tangible way.

## What's next for Clean Fit ✨
1) Get data about the cleanliness of streets via automated social media analysis or direct user input. \
2) Make it more collaborative by allowing users to form groups that will have common routes. \
3) Add social media features to increase awareness, boost usage of the product and form a network of responsible citizens. \
4) We will improve upon the responsiveness of the site, in later iterations. \
5) We plan to also convert this web application into a mobile application, and users can track the route generated for them and also gain some incentives by completing their goals.
